    <p> <h3> Hi everyone, I am Michelle, a wonderful and beautiful person.</h3> </p>
    <p> <h4> I love my sister Emily but my brother is a booger that smells...</h4> <h3>I am learning how to code html and css today with Heather Gan! She is pretty cool sometimes, but usually kinda smelly...haha. We have Allen third period together and for some reason she's listening to Sia right now, who I don't necessarily like...But it is okay!!</h3></p>
